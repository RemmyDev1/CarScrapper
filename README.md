CarScraper is a web scraping tool designed to extract car listings from AutoTrader and, in the future, Cars.com, CarGurus, and other similar websites.

How Does It Work?
        CarScraper operates by launching a Google Chrome browser session and sequentially navigating through car listing websites. It searches for available cars and extracts essential details, 

including:

        Price
        Mileage
        Model and Year
        Direct Listing Link

Requirements:
    CarScraper requires Python 3.12 or higher to function properly.
